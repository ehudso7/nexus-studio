# Disaster Recovery Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the disaster recovery procedures for Nexus Studio, ensuring business continuity in the event of system failures, data loss, or other catastrophic events.

## Recovery Objectives

- **Recovery Time Objective (RTO)**: 4 hours
- **Recovery Point Objective (RPO)**: 1 hour
- **Service Level Agreement (SLA)**: 99.9% uptime

## Backup Strategy

### Automated Backups

1. **Database Backups**
   - Full backup: Daily at 2:00 AM UTC
   - Incremental backup: Every 6 hours
   - Transaction logs: Continuous (every 5 minutes)

2. **File Storage Backups**
   - User uploads: Real-time replication to S3
   - Static assets: Daily sync to CDN
   - Configuration files: Version controlled in Git

3. **Backup Retention**
   - Daily backups: 7 days
   - Weekly backups: 4 weeks
   - Monthly backups: 12 months
   - Yearly backups: 7 years (compliance)

### Backup Locations

1. **Primary**: AWS S3 (us-east-1)
2. **Secondary**: Google Cloud Storage (us-central1)
3. **Tertiary**: Azure Blob Storage (East US)

### Backup Verification

- Automated integrity checks every 6 hours
- Weekly restore tests in staging environment
- Monthly full disaster recovery drills

## Disaster Scenarios

### 1. Database Corruption

**Detection**: Monitoring alerts, application errors

**Recovery Steps**:
1. Identify corruption timestamp
2. Stop write operations
3. Restore from latest clean backup
4. Apply transaction logs to minimize data loss
5. Verify data integrity
6. Resume operations

**Estimated Recovery Time**: 30-60 minutes

### 2. Regional Outage

**Detection**: Multi-region health checks, AWS status

**Recovery Steps**:
1. Activate failover to secondary region
2. Update DNS to point to secondary
3. Verify all services operational
4. Monitor for performance issues
5. Plan fallback once primary recovers

**Estimated Recovery Time**: 15-30 minutes

### 3. Data Center Loss

**Detection**: Complete loss of primary region

**Recovery Steps**:
1. Declare disaster status
2. Activate full DR site
3. Restore from geo-replicated backups
4. Update all DNS records
5. Notify customers via status page
6. Begin root cause analysis

**Estimated Recovery Time**: 2-4 hours

### 4. Ransomware Attack

**Detection**: Encryption alerts, unusual file activity

**Recovery Steps**:
1. Isolate affected systems
2. Activate incident response team
3. Identify attack vector and timeline
4. Restore from clean backups before infection
5. Apply security patches
6. Forensic analysis and reporting

**Estimated Recovery Time**: 4-8 hours

### 5. Accidental Data Deletion

**Detection**: User reports, audit logs

**Recovery Steps**:
1. Identify scope of deletion
2. Check soft-delete recovery options
3. Restore from point-in-time backup
4. Verify restored data
5. Update access controls

**Estimated Recovery Time**: 15-30 minutes

## Recovery Procedures

### Database Recovery

```bash
# 1. Stop application servers
kubectl scale deployment api-deployment --replicas=0

# 2. Create recovery database
createdb nexus_recovery

# 3. Restore from backup
pg_restore -d nexus_recovery /backups/nexus_2024_01_06.dump

# 4. Verify data integrity
psql nexus_recovery -c "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM projects;"

# 5. Switch application to recovery database
kubectl set env deployment/api-deployment DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:pass@host/nexus_recovery

# 6. Resume operations
kubectl scale deployment api-deployment --replicas=3
```

### File Storage Recovery

```bash
# 1. List available backups
aws s3 ls s3://nexus-backups/assets/

# 2. Restore to recovery bucket
aws s3 sync s3://nexus-backups/assets/2024-01-06/ s3://nexus-assets-recovery/

# 3. Update application configuration
kubectl set env deployment/api-deployment ASSETS_BUCKET=nexus-assets-recovery

# 4. Verify asset availability
curl https://assets-recovery.nexus-studio.io/health
```

### Full System Recovery

```bash
# 1. Provision infrastructure in DR region
terraform apply -var="region=us-west-2" -var="environment=dr"

# 2. Restore databases
./scripts/restore-all-databases.sh --source=s3://nexus-backups/latest

# 3. Sync file storage
./scripts/sync-assets.sh --source=primary --dest=dr

# 4. Deploy applications
kubectl apply -f k8s/dr/

# 5. Update DNS
./scripts/update-dns.sh --target=dr

# 6. Verify all services
./scripts/health-check-all.sh
```
